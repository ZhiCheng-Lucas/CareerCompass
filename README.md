This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the CareerCompass project.

# CareerCompass Project Deployment Guide

## Overview

CareerCompass is deployed across two platforms:

-   Frontend: Netlify
-   Backend: DigitalOcean

## Frontend Deployment

**Production URL:** https://careercompass-is216-2024.netlify.app/

### Deployment Process

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3. Deploy to Netlify:
    - Access the Netlify dashboard at https://app.netlify.com/sites/careercompass-is216-2024/deploys
    - Upload the generated `dist` directory

### API Configuration

Before building, ensure the correct API URL is set in `api.ts`:

```typescript
// Development
const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000";

// Production
// const API_URL = 'https://orca-app-8ua27.ondigitalocean.app';
```

### Access Management

-   Netlify dashboard access is managed through Zhi Cheng's GitHub authentication

## Backend Deployment

**Dashboard URL** https://cloud.digitalocean.com/
**Production URL:** https://orca-app-8ua27.ondigitalocean.app/

### Deployment Process

-   Automated CI/CD pipeline is configured
-   Changes are automatically deployed when code is pushed to the `main` branch
-   No manual deployment steps required

### Infrastructure Management

-   Platform: DigitalOcean
-   Account administrator: Zhi Cheng

## Setup Instructions

0. **Prepare OpenAPI Key:**

    - Create a file named `openai_api_key.txt` in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Add the api key to this file.
    - See pinned in our telegram group.
    - **Important:** Do not push this file to GitHub. It should already be listed in the `.gitignore` file.

1. **Prepare MongoDB Connection String:**

    - Create a file named `mongodb_connection_string.txt` in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Add your MongoDB connection string to this file.
    - See pinned in our telegram group.
    - **Important:** Do not push this file to GitHub. It should already be listed in the `.gitignore` file.

2. **Build and Run the Project:**

    - Navigate to the CareerCompass folder where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
    - Run the following command:
        ```
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

3. **Accessing the Application:**
    - Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Sample Endpoints

Try the following endpoints to test the application:

-   `http://localhost:8000/jobs/company/tiktok`
-   `http://localhost:8000/jobs/skills/sql`
-   `http://localhost:8000/jobs/title/learning`

# Job Processing API

## Overview

This API provides endpoints for user authentication, job searching, and job recommendations based on user skills. It's built with FastAPI and uses MongoDB for data storage.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Endpoints

Our API endpoints are divided into two main sections:

1. Core Functionality (Endpoints 1-9): Handles user authentication, job searches, and personalized recommendations
2. Analytics & Charts (Endpoints 10-16): Provides statistical data, market trends, and industry analyses
