## Accessibility Testing with Playwright

Our project uses Playwright and GovTech Oobee (formerly known as Purple A11y) for automated accessibility testing across all pages. The tests automatically crawl through the website and check for WCAG compliance using axe-core.

Accessibility is tested on white theme with no special options enabled.

### Progress Report

You can find all accessibility testing reports in the `./Accessibility_Report` folder. This includes:

-   GovTech Oobee (Purple A11y) reports
-   Playwright automated test results

The reports are organized by date, allowing you to:

-   Track accessibility improvements over time
-   Compare results between different testing tools

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following:

-   Project dependencies installed (`npm install`)
-   Development server running (`npm run dev`)

### Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Run the Playwright tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

3. After the tests complete, you'll see a message like:

```
Serving HTML report at http://localhost:9323. Press Ctrl+C to quit.
```

4. (optional) Record Keeping
   Find the report file in frontend/playwright-report and transfer it to CareerCompass/Testing_Report for record keeping. Rename to the file to the current date.

### Viewing Test Results

1. Open the provided URL in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:9323)
2. Click on the test to view details
3. Navigate to the bottom of the test details
4. Look for the "Attachments" section
5. Expand "stdout" to see detailed accessibility violations

### Understanding Test Output

The test results will show:

-   Total number of pages checked
-   Number of pages with violations
-   Detailed breakdown of violations per page
-   Specific WCAG rules that were violated

Example violation output:

```
Testing accessibility for: http://localhost:5173/
Found 1 violations on http://localhost:5173/
[
  {
    id: 'heading-order',
    impact: 'moderate',
    tags: [ 'cat.semantics', 'best-practice' ],
    description: 'Ensure the order of headings is semantically correct',
    help: 'Heading levels should only increase by one',
    helpUrl: 'https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/heading-order?application=playwright',
    nodes: [ [Object] ]
  }
]
```
