        # Sequential steps to execute
        steps:
            # Step 1: Check out the repository code

            - name: Build
              working-directory: ./frontend

            # Step 8: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
              id: deployment
              uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 # Handles the actual deployment

# Notes:
# - This workflow assumes your frontend Vue.js code is in a 'frontend' directory
# - The build output is expected to be in 'frontend/dist'
# - Make sure your vite.config.js has the correct base URL: base: '/CareerCompass/'
# - The deployment URL will be: https://zhicheng-lucas.github.io/CareerCompass/
