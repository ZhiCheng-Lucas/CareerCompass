Fabrica AI is reinventing how robots are developed. Currently novel robots take 5-20 years. We are building a design automation platform to bring it down to a month, and have already demonstrated significant progress by developing tile grouting robots in record time. Robotics simulation and reinforcement learning has been advancing a lot making it 1000x cheaper to train robots compared to 5 years ago, and as Jensen Huang said at Nvidia GTC 2024, ""the ChatGPT moment for robotics may be just around the corner."" A couple other companies are building on the same paradigm shift but we are the only ones using it to automate hardware design, not just software.

Building robots and a design automation platform together brings great synergy - the platform helps us develop robots faster than anyone else and the robots allow us to gather data and do experiments at scale. Data gathering can be done through partnerships with other robotics companies, but doing experiments is crucial for grounding the platform in reality and ensuring its usefulness. The grouting robots are already deploying daily at construction sites and bringing value to clients. We are currently negotiating sales worth around 500k USD. With manufacturing cost multiple times lower than companies using a traditional robotic arm, our robots have an ROI in weeks. Our robot is also small and simple to use, operating from a single button without the need to upload floorplans or do any complex setup. Soon we would be expanding into other simple and valuable robots for the construction industry.

We’ve raised over 2.5m USD from Hoxton Ventures, Credo Ventures, our Professor from Cambridge University, Woh Hup, and the owner of BHCC (listed construction company). We’ve 2500sqft of space in Singapore where we have over 20 team members, and 1200sqft of space in Czechia where we have our software team.

Jakub Suchanek (CEO) has an engineering degree from the University of Cambridge and experience working on self-driving cars at Wayve and machine learning at Granta Innovation and Wacker. He is a worldwide winner of NASA SpaceApps and has won bronze medals in International Olympiads in Informatics and Physics.

Ronald Luc (CTO) earned a degree in Math and Computer Science from Masaryk University, where he was a teaching assistant, and supervised several deep learning theses. He has years of industry experience in both machine learning and self driving cars. With Jakub he won TechFest Munich, one of the EU’s top hackathons; and represented Czechia at the International Olympiad in Informatics.

Keefe Wayne Teo (COO & CFO), a University of Cambridge engineering graduate, served as president of Hackbridge.io, promoting entrepreneurship in tech. He has 100+ citations in research journals and four papers on sustainable energy. He previously worked at Entrepreneur First and has business development experience from other companies.
